# Specifying sources

Developers and content creators need to be able to:

* specify 'breakpoints' or media matching options for each source image using the same vocabulary as we use for style definitions for media matching,
* use relative units, so the end user retains ultimate control over the base font-size, and
* art direct output.

note:

- Specify images sources **with appropriate metadata**
