# Ultimate control

Finally, a we want the user to have ultimate control, so at a minimum the user should be able to:

* modify the base font-size without that breaking responsive imagery, and
* manually request imagery which matches specific characteristics.


note:

User changes should:

- **remain effective** and
- **not break layout**.
