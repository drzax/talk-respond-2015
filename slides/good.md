# Automatic image selection

The browser should automatically select the most appropriate image, taking into account:

* display resolution,
* viewport resolution,
* device pixel density,
* media features and types,
* quality and speed of the connection.

# Specifying sources

Developers and content creators need to be able to:

* specify 'breakpoints' or media matching options for each source image using the same vocabulary as we use for style definitions for media matching,
* use relative units, so the end user retains ultimate control over the base font-size, and
* art direct output.

# Ultimate control

Finally, a we want the user to have ultimate control, so at a minimum the user should be able to:

* modify the base font-size without that breaking responsive imagery, and
* manually request imagery which matches specific characteristics.
