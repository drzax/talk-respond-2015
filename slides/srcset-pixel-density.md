## <code>srcset</code>


<pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
&lt;img src="http://placehold.it/500x500" alt="A placeholder"<span class="fragment fade-out" data-fragment-index="1">></span>
     <span class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1">srcset="http://placehold.it/750x750 1.5x,
             http://placehold.it/1000x1000 2x"></span>
</code></pre>


note:
- `srcset` is a fine place to start beginning with responsive imagery. I
  think it gets you the most bang for your buck.
- In fact, there are good arguments to be made that you should not be using
  <picture> most of the time.
